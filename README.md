# Export Variants to CSV or XML
### Notes for self.
- Look into Progress bar & wonkiness.
- Examples of CSV imports
  - Difference between Specific & Sum of parts?
  - Can you import default variants with CSV?
- Add tabs/ indents to xml for my own sanity
- Options:
  - Export to File name [ add file name here ]
    - Will go to data (For testing purposes, currently goes to scripts)
  - Email? Y/N. Y: [ Add Email here, default store email ]
  - Export specific variants for [product_code]?
  - Export ONLY [sum of parts, specific, master + attributes ]?
  - Export Product Kits?
    - Test use cases

### Currently works
- Export to file (static, test.xml)
- Export to XML (default variants, and regular variants)
